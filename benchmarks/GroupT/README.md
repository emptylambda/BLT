A selection of tests from Boogie's `Test` directory that may be usable
with blt. Even if some of these are supposed to be run with special
Boogie options, the idea is to compare the outcome against Boogie
called without any special option. If any example contains language
features not supported by blt, it can be discarded from the
experiments.
