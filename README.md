### What is BLT?
- BLT is a tool: it takes programs written in
  [Boogie IVL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/boogie-an-intermediate-verification-language/)
  (only suppports the core subset of Boogie language at the moment, we
  are working toward supporting the full language) and outputs
  first-order logic conjectures using
  [TPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) syntax. TPTP (stands for
  Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) is similar to the default
  Boogie target language, SMTLib, as they are both based on
  first-order logic and theories and it is considered as a widely
  accepted language standard for automated theorem provers. The
  verification conditions generated by BLT utilized some of the recent
  improvements of TPTP, hence we suggest to use BLT together with the
  [Vampire](http://www.vprover.org/) theorem prover as its backend.

- BLT is also a translation scheme: to appear!

- Finally, BLT is a papper: to appear!
