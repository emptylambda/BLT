### What is BLT?
- BLT is a tool: it feeds on programs written in [Boogie IVL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/boogie-an-intermediate-verification-language/) (core subset of the entire language, we are working toward supporting the full language) and outputs first-order logic conjectures in [TPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) syntax; the TPTP standard, similar to existing Boogie target language SMTLib, is a widely accepted language standard for theorem provers. However, unlike SMTLib, TPTP is not geared toward the SMT solvers but general automated theoerem provers (ATP). In BLT's usage case, we are currently targeting one specific ATP due to its recent improvements: [Vampire](http://www.vprover.org/).
